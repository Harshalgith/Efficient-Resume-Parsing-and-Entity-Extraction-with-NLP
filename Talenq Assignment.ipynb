Our solution\\nincorporates Phase Change Material (PCM), a wax-like substance renowned for its excellent heat storage properties.\\n•The PCM acts as a reservoir, absorbing surplus heat generated during cooking. As the PCM absorbs thermal energy, it\\nundergoes a phase change from solid to liquid, effectively storing the energy. When additional heat is required for culinary\\noperations, the stored energy is released as the PCM undergoes a reverse phase change, serving as a supplemental\\nheat source. Integrating this PCM-based system into culinary settings minimizes heat loss during cooking, offering a\\nsustainable and energy-efficient solution.\\nEXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES\\nStocks Trading, Swing Trading\\n•This involves buying and selling assets over short- to medium-term periods to capture price swings in financial markets,\\noffering opportunities for skill development and potential additional income with careful risk management.\\nPlaying Cricket\\n•As an avid participant in school cricket.Representing my school in various tournaments, I not only showcased my athletic\\nabilities but also fostered camaraderie and sportsmanship among teammates.
